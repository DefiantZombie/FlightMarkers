# FlightMarkers

Adds information markers previously available in the editors to the flight scene.

## Installation

#### NEVER RUN KSP MODDED FROM THE STEAM FOLDER!

- Windows: Extract the archive to your KSP/GameData folder.

- Mac: If you have other Squidsoft Collective mods, overwrite the KSP/GameData/Squidsoft Collective/<Mod Name> folder and update ModuleManager as required.

## Usage

### Enable Advanced Tweakables

- From the main menu: Go to Settings->General. This will not change the option for games in progress.

- From the space center or flight scenes: Press Escape and choose Settings. It will be under the Gameplay section.

### Flight Scene

After the Advanced Tweakables option is enabled the Flight Markers option becomes available on the part action menu in the flight scene. Toggle this option to display the markers. Once enabled there is also an option to display the average of the body lift and surface lift, or split them.

### Settings

The lift and drag marker cuton/offs can be adjusted using the game difficulty options screen. These settings are saved per-save.

### Control From Where?

FlightMarkers adds the ability to find the part currently in control of a vessel: Right-click any part -> Find Control Part

If auto-highlight is enabled in the game settings, parts will highlight on control switch. This should help when using action groups to switch.

## Notes

- A lot of the math behind this mod is rough (opinion) and displays oddities in certain situations. It's planned to make things better over time.

- Everything should work fine across multiple craft in flight. Please be aware that not a lot of testing has been done on this.
